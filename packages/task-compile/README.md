## Goat
Goat is a simple to use taskrunner for frontend development. Build for quick intergration, rich features and easy updating even when working with a team. 

## Why Goat
Instead of defining and maintaining separate setups for compiling, linting and building your code, goat aims to have a predefined, flexible setup that's easy to initialize and to keep up to date.
