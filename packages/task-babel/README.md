# Goat Babel
Automatically compile your ES6 to ES5 compatible code. Files suffixed with `.es6.js` will be detected and converted to work according to the defined browser support settings.

## Goat
Goat is a simple to use taskrunner for frontend development. 

## Why Goat
Instead of defining and maintaining separate setups for compiling, linting and building your code, goat aims to have a predefined, flexible setup that's easy to initialize and to keep up to date.
